# Classification Task README
## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a classification task involving implementing classification models, performing hyperparameter tuning, comparing model performance, and submitting the results.

## Task Description
The task involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
   - Managing categorical variables if necessary.
2. **Classification Models:**
   - Implementing the following classification models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Applying hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance.
   - Documenting the rationale behind the choices made during hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Model Comparison:**
   - Evaluating model performance using classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
   - Comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
   - Creating visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices, ROC curves) for better comparison.
5. **Notebook Submission:**
   - Preparing a Jupyter notebook containing code, explanations, and visualizations.
   - Ensuring well-organized code with comments for clarity.
   - Saving the notebook as a PDF file for submission.

## Files Included
- Jupyter notebook containing code and explanations.
- README.md (this file) providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relevant Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
